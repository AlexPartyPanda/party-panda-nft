Colourful onchain composable NFTs based on my toy panda (Rona).

Party Panda NFTs are composable NFTs so they can be added to composable NFTs.  e.g. Loogie Tank NFT (like a fish tank) where Nouns Glasses NFTs and Party Pandas NFTs are gently swimming around the tank after being added to the tank NFT:
